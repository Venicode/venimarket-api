<h2 id="database">üìùDatabase</h2>

<p>For this project, I choose the H2 Database, it stores data in memomy, being ideal for testing, it doesn't not persist the data on disk. So, when closing the terminal, all data will be lost.</p>

<h2 id="br">üìùBusiness Rules</h2>
<p>Before create a request, read the business rules below:</p>
<p>Only have three method payments that must be register following in this way:</p>
- CASH <br>
- CREDITCARD<br>
- PIX<br>
<p>The same thing is applied when you will register a product, which there are only two category products:</p>
- GROCEY<br>
- DRINKS<br>
<p>When you register a new sell, if it's your first once, a new cash register will create. But, in your second sell, the balance will be added, unless you close the cash register. If the last cash register is closed, a new one will be create.</p>
